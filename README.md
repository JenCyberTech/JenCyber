# JenWeb
Welcome to my first GitHub repository!
As a passionate Full Stack Developer and lifelong learner, this repository serves as a collection of my initial projects, web applications, and coding experiments in front-end, back-end, and full stack development. From building user interfaces to crafting robust APIs and databases, I’m excited to showcase my journey and growth in the world of web development.
I’m always open to collaboration and eager to learn new technologies, frameworks, and best practices in the ever-evolving field of software engineering!
